# IntroductionToRobotics
Resources for the IntroductionToRobotics course, taken in the 3rd year of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Faculty of Matematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

In this repository, I will upload the homeworks and final projects. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code, a circuit diagram and a demo video.

## Homework 1
The first

## Homework 2

### Components
* RGB LED (at least 1)
* Potentiometers (at least 3)
* Resistors and wires as needed

### Technical Task
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED (Red, Green, and Blue). This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.
